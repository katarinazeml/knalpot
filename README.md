## Final game idea
2D platformer with puzzles. There is a room with 2 players in it. The main task is to solve the puzzles in the room in order to pass on. There will be 1 hour allocated to each room. 
Players will be introduced as students. The main theme of the quests will be university tasks: write a test, turn in a paper on time, make a blueprint, read documentation etc. 
Each character will have a list of abilities that can be chosen before the game starts. In order for the "skills" not to be exploited, stamina is introduced in the form of "burnout". The greater the student's burnout, the more side-effects they experience: hallucinations, slowness, lower jump, and more. Burnout can be recovered by resting in the lounge area (WIP). Abilities can be upgraded as well using currency called PEA.

## Project plan
### Sprint I
* [x] Finalize game theme
* [x] Develop basic physics engine (includes gravity, character movement, collisions etc)
* [x] Create basic server-side prototype (two clients = two players and etc)
* [x] Synching two players' movements using server prototype
* [x] Get the basic stuff working :')
* [x] Divide roles between team members (server/client)

### Sprint II
* [ ] In-depth study of LibGDX
* [ ] Adding first map prototype into the game
* [ ] Testing previously created functions
* [ ] Basic AI character to be used when person plays alone (WIP)
* [ ] Basic menu / splash screen
* [ ] Small optimizations

### Sprint III
* [ ] Finalizing server-related "feature"
* [ ] Add final version of first map (with collisions and etc)
* [ ] Add interactive elements (open books, hack the PC, move objects, connect console cable to a node)
* [ ] Add stamina-related feature ("Burn-out scale")
* [ ] Add stamina-related effects (when scale reaches 5, player moves slowed, dizzy effect etc)

### Sprint IV
* [ ] Improve graphics (for myself (makkusu): add some effects like dynamic lightning etc)
* [ ] Create a first human-like character to be used as main player (might add animations if we won't be lazy)
* [ ] Develop our little child (AI)
* [ ] Further improve server-side code (fix bugs, optimize etc)
* [ ] PEA as currency (can buy abilities, spells, open secret levels when you have enough PEA)

### Sprint V
* [ ] Plan other levels (around three of them), create a testing-map for them
* [ ] Finalize server-side code so it can be installed on a server
* [ ] Add lounge zone (so player can restore his stamina and have fun)
* [ ] Add barebone "abilities upgrade" function
* [ ] Add sound effects and simple music

### Sprint VI
* [ ] Fix bugs, improve and optimize code
* [ ] Add other levels
* [ ] Share our game among other people known as "testers"
* [ ] Collect feedback

### Sprint VII
* [ ] Most likely it won't be anything but fixing bugs, improving code, testing, deploying etc
